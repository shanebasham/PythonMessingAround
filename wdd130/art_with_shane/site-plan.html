        For example:
        Hey everyone! My name is Shane Basham, I am 21 years old, and I was born and raised in Tucson, Arizona. 
        I love learning new languages, making art, running, cooking, listening to music, playing the piano, and playing games!
        Ive been making art since I was 5 years old and have taken art classes every year since.
        On this art portfolio I will display multiple artworks I have created with a title, description, and/or story by the pictures.
        I hope you enjoy and find some inspiration from my art, and I hope you find some that you really like and would love to have in your home!
